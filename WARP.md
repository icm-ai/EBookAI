# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

EBookAI is a modern e-book processing platform integrated with AI capabilities, supporting multi-format conversion, intelligent typesetting, content generation, and professional publishing.

## Project Status

This is a newly initialized repository with minimal structure. The project currently contains:
- Basic repository configuration (LICENSE, README.md, .gitignore)
- Git repository initialized with initial commit
- Python-focused .gitignore indicating this will be a Python-based project

## Development Environment Setup

Since this is an early-stage project, the development environment and toolchain are not yet established. The .gitignore suggests this will be a Python project with support for various Python dependency management tools including:
- pip/virtualenv
- Poetry
- Pipenv  
- PDM
- UV
- Pixi

## Architecture Notes

The project architecture is not yet implemented. Based on the project description, the system will likely include:
- Multi-format e-book conversion capabilities
- AI integration for content generation and intelligent typesetting
- Publishing workflow management
- Support for professional e-book formatting and layout

## Key Considerations for Development

- The project uses MIT License (permissive open-source)
- .gitignore is comprehensive and includes modern Python tooling
- Project targets e-book processing, AI integration, and publishing workflows
- No existing codebase means architectural decisions are still pending

## Next Steps for Development

Future development should establish:
1. Python dependency management system choice
2. Project structure and module organization  
3. AI service integration patterns
4. E-book format handling libraries and tools
5. Testing and CI/CD configuration
6. Documentation structure

## Notes

This repository is in initial setup phase. Once development begins, this WARP.md should be updated to reflect the actual architecture, build commands, testing procedures, and development workflows.
